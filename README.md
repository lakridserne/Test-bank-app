# Test bank app


We'll use this bank app, written in C# to do some testing. It'll be TDD for the most part.

## Assignment 1
Implement movement class, so money can move from one account to another, and we have a good way of tracking the money.

## Assignment 2
Make a contract, so we have a good way of interacting between backend and frontend, and it's clearly defined the roles for both backend and frontend.

## Assignment 3
Database tests (to be done)
