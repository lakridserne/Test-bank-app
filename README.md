# Test bank app


We'll use this bank app, written in C# to do some testing. It'll be TDD for the most part.

## Assignment 1
Implement movement class, so money can move from one account to another, and we have a good way of tracking the money.

## Assignment 2
Make a contract, so we have a good way of interacting between backend and frontend, and it's clearly defined the roles for both backend and frontend.

### Solution
We spent a long time coming up with a solution to this project as it was very difficult given the way the project was set up.
We ended up creating an interface in the backend locally, instead of using the interface in the contract - as that was not possible.

## Assignment 3
Database tests (to be done)
